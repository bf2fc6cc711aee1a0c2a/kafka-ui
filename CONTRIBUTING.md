## Coding Standards

The Kafka UI projects uses best practices based off the official [React TypeScript Cheat sheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/), with modifications for this project. The React TypeScript Cheat sheet is maintained and used by developers through out the world, and is a place where developers can bring together lessons learned using TypeScript and React.

### Imports

Since we are using TypeScript 4.x + for this project, default imports should conform to the new standard set forth in TypeScript 2.7:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

For imports that are not the default import use the following syntax:

```typescript
import { X1, X2, ... Xn } from 'package-x';
```

### View Props

Since Kafka UI is made up of 2 different views (one for PatternFly, and one for Carbon) props for a component should be declared in separate file instead of within the components source code. For example Carbon views are written in **View.carbon.tsx**, while PatternFly views are written in **View.patternfly.tsx**. In order to allow the views to share the same props, the code for the props should live in **View.props.tsx**.

For props we are using **type** instead of **interfaces**. The reason to use types instead of interfaces is for consistency between the views and because it's more constrained (See [Types or Interfaces](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/types_or_interfaces) for more clarification). By using types we are ensuring that both views will not deviate from the agreed upon [contract](https://dev.to/reyronald/typescript-types-or-interfaces-for-react-component-props-1408).

The following is an example of using a type for props:

```typescript
export type ExampleComponentProps = {
  message: string;
};
```

Since we are using typescript we no longer need to use prop-types as typescript provides the functionality we received with prop-types via types. To set the default value of the props you can do so in by specifying a value in the argument's for the function component. The following is an example on how to do that:

```typescript
type GreetProps = { age?: number };

const Greet: FunctionComponent<GreetingProps> = ({ age = 21 }: GreetProps) => // etc
```

### State objects should be types

When maintaining state for a component that requires it's state to be defined by an object, it is recommended that you use a [type instead of an interface](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/types_or_interfaces). For example if you need to maintain the currentApiId and isExpanded in a single object you can do the following:

```typescript
type ApiDrawerState = {
  currentApiId: string;
  isExpanded: boolean;
};
```

### Interfaces

Interfaces should be used for all public facing API definitions, as well as models. A table describing when to use interfaces vs. types can be found [here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/types_or_interfaces).

```typescript
// The following is an example of memory information model

export interface MemoryInfoRepresentation {
  total: number;
  totalFormatted: string;
  used: number;
  usedFormatted: string;
  free: number;
  freePercentage: number;
  freeFormatted: string;
}
```

### Function Components

This project uses function components and hooks over class components. When coding function components in typescript a developer should include any specific props from the **View.props.tsx**

```typescript
export const ExampleComponent: FunctionComponent<ExampleComponentProps> = ({
  message,
  children,
}: ExampleComponentProps) => (
  <>
    <div>{message}</div>
    <div>{children}</div>
  </>
);
```

For components that do not have any additional props an empty object should be used instead:

```typescript
export const ExampleNoPropsComponent: FunctionComponent<{}> = () => (
  <div>Example Component with no props</div>
);
```

Additional details around function components can be found [here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/function_components).

### Hooks

When using hooks with Typescript there are few recommendations that we follow below. Additional recommendations besides the ones mention in this document can be found [here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/hooks).

#### Inference vs Types for useState

Currently we recommend using inference for the primitive types booleans, numbers, and string when using useState. Anything other then these 3 types should use a declarative syntax to specify what is expected. For example the following is an example of how to use inference:

```typescript
const [isEnabled, setIsEnabled] = React.useState(false);
```

Here is an example how to use a declarative syntax. When using a declarative syntax if the value can be null that will also need to be specified:

```typescript
const [user, setUser] = useState<IUser | null>(null);

setUser(newUser);
```

#### useReducers

When using reducers make sure you specify the [return type and do not use inference](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/hooks#usereducer).

```typescript
const initialState = { count: 0 };

type ACTIONTYPE =
  | { type: 'increment'; payload: number }
  | { type: 'decrement'; payload: string };

function reducer(state: typeof initialState, action: ACTIONTYPE) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + action.payload };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - Number(action.payload) };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement', payload: '5' })}>
        -
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment', payload: 5 })}>
        +
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### useEffect

For useEffect only [return the function or undefined](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/hooks#useeffect).

```typescript
function DelayedEffect(props: { timerMs: number }) {
  const { timerMs } = props;
  // bad! setTimeout implicitly returns a number because the arrow function body isn't wrapped in curly braces
  useEffect(
    () =>
      setTimeout(() => {
        /* do stuff */
      }, timerMs),
    [timerMs]
  );
  return null;
}
```

#### useRef

When using useRef there are two options with Typescript. The first one is when creating a [read-only ref](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/hooks#useref).

```typescript
const refExample = useRef<HTMLElement>(null!);
```

By passing in null! it will prevent Typescript from returning an error saying refExample maybe null.

The second option is for creating [mutable refs](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/hooks#useref) that you will manage.

```typescript
const refExampleMutable = (useRef < HTMLElement) | (null > null);
```

### Additional Typescript Pointers

Besides the details outlined above a list of recommendations for Typescript is maintained by several Typescript React developers [here](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/). This is a great reference to use for any additional questions that are not outlined within the coding standards.
